# README – Data Visualization and Preprocessing Lab

## Purpose of the Lab

The lab is designed to explore, clean, and analyze datasets in order to extract meaningful insights. Fundamental skills in data visualization, preprocessing, and statistical analysis are introduced.
________________________________________
Step 1: Data Collection
A dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and its structure is inspected. Familiarity with the dataset’s variables and sample records is ensured.
________________________________________
Step 2: Data Visualization
Charts and plots are used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. An intuitive understanding of numerical and categorical variables is provided.
________________________________________
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
The dataset is cleaned and prepared by handling missing values, detecting outliers, reducing unnecessary features, and scaling or categorizing data. This ensures the dataset is ready for accurate analysis.
________________________________________
Step 4: Statistical Analysis
The dataset is summarized using descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency and dispersion, and correlation analysis. Data characteristics and relationships are quantified for deeper insights.

## Conclusion
A complete workflow for turning raw data into meaningful insights is demonstrated, combining visualization, preprocessing, and statistical techniques.
